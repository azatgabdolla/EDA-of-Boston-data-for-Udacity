# Summary

All in all, in Boston on average each apartment is available 50% of the time throughout the year. Total apartments availability is uniform with a decrease in September and October, which is instantly displayed with price increase within these months. Apart from the seasonal volatility, the price, of an apartment is described by three major groups of factors: neighborhood, apartment characteristics, and the profile of a host. Lastly, if to put a price aside, experience in apartments is described by hosts with objective characteristics, while guests are open to express their stay experience emotionally. These insights were extracted from Boston Airbnb open data that was collected for the 2016â€“2017 years.
